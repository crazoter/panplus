                    my policies with the collection, use, and
                    disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use
                    my Extension.
                  </p> <p>
                    If you choose to use my Extension, then you agree
                    to the collection and use of information in relation to this
                    policy.
                  </p><p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                    This Extension does not request or collect any personally identifiable information or authentication information.
                    This Extension will only collect information regarding your use of webcasts and user settings.
                    The information collected will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

                    The Extension uses third party services such as Google and Panopto. They may collect

                    Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                    commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are
                    sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and
                    are stored on your device's internal memory.
                  </p> <p>
                    This Extension does not use these “cookies” explicitly.
                    However, the app may use third party code and libraries that
                    use “cookies” to collect information and improve their
                    services. You have the option to either accept or refuse
                    these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your
                    device.

                    This Extension may contain links to other sites. If you click
                    on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
